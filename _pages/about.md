I am an undergraduated student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at [Yingcai Honors College](https://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/en/AboutYingcai.htm), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).My research interest focused on Multi-modal LLMs, LLMs and AI for science.

I previously worked as a research intern in [Fan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=kTd978wAAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab, specializing in neuroimage processing, Medical Image Analysis and Multi-modal AI. I also work closely with [Yi-kai Zhang](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhangyk/) in LAMDA GROUP.
